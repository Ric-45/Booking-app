# Booking-app
This Go program is a basic console-based ticket booking application for a conference, designed to demonstrate concurrent programming, user input handling, and modular code structure. The application allows users to book tickets for the "Go Conference" by entering their personal details and desired number of tickets. It uses a custom userData struct to store user information, and all bookings are maintained in a slice. The main function handles the application flow, beginning with a welcome message, user input collection, validation (delegated to an external helper package), and ticket booking. If the input is valid, a confirmation is displayed, and a goroutine is used to simulate sending the ticket asynchronously. The use of the sync.WaitGroup ensures the main thread waits for all goroutines to complete before exiting. Key functions include greetUsers() for introductions, getUserInput() for user interaction, bookTicket() to process the booking, and sendTicket() to simulate email confirmation. The application effectively illustrates Goâ€™s features such as goroutines, slices, structs, and basic synchronization. It is a suitable example for beginners learning Go and exploring concurrent programming patterns in real-world inspired applications.
